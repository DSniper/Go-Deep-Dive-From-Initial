Hello All In this session we will be having a close look to Go from Inital to have a freindly work experince with Go.
Lets Stat........

Go is a general purpose programming language with advanced features an clean syntax. Because of its wide availablity and online support on various platforms,
    its well-documneted common library, and its focus o god software wngineering priniples .
Go is an ideal language to learn as first programming langugage.

Every Language has it own Blocks so do go have ,
Data Types      
            1) Atomic 
            2) unsafe 
            3) Abstract
                        Atomic data types include
                            1) String
                            2) int
                            3) int32
                            4) int64
                            5) uint
                            6) uint32
                            7) uint64
                        unsafe
                            1) Pointers
                        Abstract Data types
                             1) map[]<datatype>
                             2) struct{}
                             3) interface()
 Lets deep dive to Atomic Data types
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Integer----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Example 1:To declare a single variable
                    package main()
                    import "fmt"    //fmt is usedfor formatting 
                    func main(){
                    var a int       // to declare a variable 
                    a=2
                    fmt.Println(a)  // always rember that formaatting matters in Go 
                    }
Example 2 :To decalsre multiple variables
                    package main()
                    import "fmt"
                    func main(){
                    var {               //hear it will convert it explicit
                            a=2
                            b=3
                        }
                    fmt.Println(a+b)
                   }
Example 3: Type casting example 
            1) package main()
               import "fmt"
               func main()
               {
               var a int32
               var b int64
               fmt.Println(a+b)                     //this will throw an error as of diffrent data types hence we make use of type casting
               }
            2) Now lets see after type casting 
                package main()
                import "fmt"
                func main()
                {
                    var a int32
                    var b int64
                    fmt.Println(int64(a)+b)         //as we have type casted so it will work but we will get 0 as no value given 
                }
            3) Way to initalize a variabl in Go 
                package main()
                import "fmt"
                func main(){
                a:=1
                b:=2
                fmt.Println(a+b)                    // we will get summation as answer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------String----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are Strings -  A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.
                    Strings plays a vital role in helping manuplating and structuring the data .
                    In a world od possiblities we started from  0 and 1 and we made so beautiful creations then we have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 which added more bueaty but Strings helped in next level 
                    In our day 2 day activites we mostly read normal letters hence Strings help us in extracting scrapping automating and many more ways.
                    
Example 1: Wap to print Hello World.
                Step 1:-   package main
                Step 2:-   import "fmt"
                Step 3:-   func main()
                Step 4:-   {
                Step 5:-   fmt.Println("Hello world")
                Step 6:-   }
            Now lets undestand the code :
                Step 1:- Is called package decleration. Every Program in Go must start with a package decleration
                         Packages are Go's way of Organizing and reusing the code.
                         Their are two types of Go Programs 
                            1)Executable
                                        Executalble applications are king of applicationsthat we ca run directly from the terminal
                                        like in windows they end with .exe files 
                            2)Libiraries
                                        Libiraries are collections of code that we package together so that w can use them in other 
                                        programs.
                Step 2:- Next line of our code is a blank line 
                            Go mostly doen't care abiut white space , we use it to make programs easier to read.           
                Step 3:- Then we se import "fmt"
                                    impoer keyword is how we include code from other programs to use with our programs.
                                    The fmt package (shorthand of format) implements formatting for imput and output.
                Step 4:-  We have comment in GO .
                              Comments start with // or /* */ whom do we call as single line comment of multi line comment .
                              These are for user to understand not for compiler as coompiler will skip these lines.
                Step 5:-  Then we have function decleration 
                            func mian(){
                            fmt.Println("Hello world")
                            }
                          Functions are building blocks of a GO Program.
                
               Now as had a good Understanding of code lets start with Programs .
               Example 1: WAP to Print "I am awesome"
                         package main                                                                                      Note :- if your code is not running Please vist https://play.golang.org/ and 
                                                                                                                                   format you code its may be formatting issue if you are sure you had              
                         import "fmt"                                                                                              enterd correct keywords
                         
                         func main() {                                                                                              
                                    fmt.Println("I am awesome")
                         }
